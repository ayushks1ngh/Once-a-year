You are a senior front-end developer and creative designer.

Build a visually beautiful, romantic Valentine Week website using ONLY:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

The website should be beginner-friendly, lightweight, and run in a single Replit project.

==============================
CORE IDEA
==============================
This is a private Valentine Week website for one person.
Each day, new content unlocks automatically based on the current date.
Old days remain visible, future days stay locked.

No backend. No database. No login system.

==============================
STRUCTURE
==============================
Create exactly these files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

==============================
DATE LOGIC
==============================
Valentine Week starts on:
February 7 (Day 1 – Rose Day)
and ends on:
February 14 (Day 7 – Valentine’s Day)

Use JavaScript date logic to:
- Calculate which day it is
- Show content only up to today
- Lock future days with a soft "locked" UI

Refreshing the page should NOT break anything.

==============================
VISUAL DESIGN (VERY IMPORTANT)
==============================
The site must look:
- Cute
- Soft
- Dreamy
- Romantic
- Minimal

Use:
- Pastel colors
- Animated backgrounds
- Slow, calming animations (NO fast motion)
- Centered content
- Mobile-first responsive design

==============================
BACKGROUND ANIMATIONS
==============================
Create animated backgrounds using CSS (no videos).

Use:
- Floating hearts
- Floating petals
- Soft gradient movement

Animations should be subtle and loop smoothly.

Each day should have a slightly different background color theme.

==============================
LAYOUT
==============================
Single-page layout.
No scrolling.

For each unlocked day:
- Day title (e.g. "Day 1 – Rose Day 🌹")
- One short romantic message (4–6 lines max)
- One cute animated visual element (heart, teddy, rose, etc.)
- Soft fade-in animation

For locked days:
- Show a blurred card
- Lock icon
- Text: "Unlocks soon 💭"

==============================
CONTENT (PLACEHOLDERS OK)
==============================
Add placeholder romantic text for each day.
Keep it gentle, respectful, and cute.
NO sexual or explicit content.

Example tone:
"Some feelings grow quietly,
like this one.
No rush.
Just something I wanted you to feel today."

==============================
DAY THEMES
==============================
Day 1 – Rose Day 🌹 → petals + pink theme
Day 2 – Propose Day 💍 → hearts + blush theme
Day 3 – Chocolate Day 🍫 → warm pastel theme
Day 4 – Teddy Day 🧸 → beige / cute theme
Day 5 – Promise Day 🤞 → lavender calm theme
Day 6 – Hug Day 🤍 → warm peach theme
Day 7 – Valentine’s Day ❤️ → romantic gradient + final reveal

==============================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
==============================
- Clean, well-commented code
- No external frameworks
- Optional Google Font (romantic handwritten or soft font)
- Use CSS keyframes for animations
- JavaScript should be simple and readable

==============================
FINAL TOUCH
==============================
On Day 7:
- Show a special final message
- Add a gentle heart animation
- No pressure language
- End with warmth and honesty

==============================
OUTPUT
==============================
Return:
- Full HTML code
- Full CSS code
- Full JavaScript code

Make it elegant, cute, and emotionally impactful.
