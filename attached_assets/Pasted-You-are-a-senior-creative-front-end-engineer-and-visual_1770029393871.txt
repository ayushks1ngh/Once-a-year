You are a senior creative front-end engineer and visual designer.

I already have a working Valentine Week website in Replit where:
• Each day unlocks based on date
• Each day generates unique quotes dynamically
• Clicking a day opens a dedicated page/section

Your task is NOT to change logic.
Your task is to deeply customize the VISUAL EXPERIENCE of each day.

Focus on Day 1 – ROSE DAY only for now.

==============================
ROSE DAY — VISUAL DIRECTION
==============================

This page should feel:
• Soft
• Romantic
• Elegant
• Calm
• Dream-like

NOT loud.
NOT harsh red.
NOT visually noisy.

Think:
“Rose petals drifting slowly in warm air.”

==============================
COLOR THEME
==============================

Use dusty pastel rose tones, not bright red.

Target palette:
• Soft blush / dusty rose background
• Muted rose accent color
• Warm dark text
• Gentle glow effects

Colors should never clash or strain the eyes.

==============================
BACKGROUND ANIMATION
==============================

When Rose Day is opened:

• Add a dedicated animated background layer
• Use elegant rose-related visuals (roses, petals, floral shapes)
• Elements should move slowly and naturally
• No videos
• No fast motion
• No heavy assets

Examples of motion:
• Petals falling slowly
• A single rose gently blooming or pulsing
• Very subtle floating movement

The animation must feel calm and romantic, not playful.

==============================
QUOTES PRESENTATION
==============================

Quotes already exist and are dynamically generated.

Visually:
• Quotes should float softly over the background
• Low opacity
• Gentle drifting motion
• Elegant typography
• Quotes should feel “discovered”, not shouted

They must never overpower the visuals.

==============================
PAGE BEHAVIOR
==============================

• Rose Day visuals activate ONLY when Rose Day is opened
• They are removed or hidden when navigating away
• Other days remain untouched

This must be modular so future days can have completely different visual systems.

==============================
DESIGN RULES
==============================

• One main visual focus (avoid clutter)
• Slow animations (20–30s loops)
• Plenty of empty space
• Mobile-first
• Emotion > decoration

==============================
FINAL GOAL
==============================

The user should feel:
“This feels personal.”
“This is soft and thoughtful.”
“This doesn’t feel like a template.”

Do NOT add text explanations.
Do NOT modify business logic.
Only enhance visuals and animation for Rose Day.

Implement this cleanly and professionally.
